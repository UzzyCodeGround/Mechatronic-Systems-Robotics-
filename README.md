**Mechatronic-Systems-Robotics-** 

This repository contains my two main assignments that I programmed using Mathcad as part of my Mechatronic Systems course. These assignments demonstrate my ability to model, analyze, and program robotic systems by leveraging the principles of mechatronics, mathematics, and control theory.

## Contents

Each folder contains: Matlab program files: These files were used to perform the computations and generate the results presented in the PDF reports.

## Trajectory and Motion Analysis
 
	This assignment involves the analysis of robotic motion, including position, velocity, and acceleration trajectories. The project focuses on simulating the movement of a robotic system along predefined paths, using trapezoidal velocity profiles for smooth motion transitions.
	Key topics: Position trajectory, velocity trajectory, acceleration trajectory, trapezoidal velocity profiles ￼ ￼.	
    
## Assignment 6: Robot Control and Path Following

   In this assignment, I programmed a robot to follow a defined trajectory and reach specific target points. The robot’s position and orientation were controlled to ensure accurate and smooth motion towards the target.
   Key topics: Robot orientation control, error minimization, trajectory following, and simulation of robot motion
